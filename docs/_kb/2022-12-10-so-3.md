I see the option to add tags to my question or answer… what are tags and why should I use them?

Tags are keywords that you can add to a question or answer. Along with keywords in the question or answer itself, these tags help to organize content and make searching easier. Tags also power notifications - so if you’re interested in something, make sure to follow that tag to get the latest information.

We added a few common tags to this question so you can see for yourself.

Tags: [product](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/product "show questions tagged &#39;product&#39;") [onboarding](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/onboarding "show questions tagged &#39;onboarding&#39;") [training](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/training "show questions tagged &#39;training&#39;") [development](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/development "show questions tagged &#39;development&#39;") [scrum](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/scrum "show questions tagged &#39;scrum&#39;") [hr](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/hr "show questions tagged &#39;hr&#39;") [office-questions](/c/formsbyair/questions/tagged/office-questions "show questions tagged &#39;office-questions&#39;")
