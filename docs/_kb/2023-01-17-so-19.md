For example, I want do something like this

Just change the filter to this \(without quotes\)...

table.&lt;&lt;AccountType.Value&gt;&gt; == 1

Bear in mind…

- This will error if AccountType is blank so make sure your Lookup appears later in the form when you definitely have an AccountType
- Make sure the values for AccountType match **exactly** to column names in your table
