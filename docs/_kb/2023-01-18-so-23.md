Go to Documents &gt; Log in our portal and check a recent submission - if our logs indicate that delivery was successful then this is almost certainly a synching issue between OneDrive/GoogleDrive/Dropbox and your local device. Please log in to OneDrive/GoogleDrive/Dropbox in a web browser to check. If the files exist online then check the OneDrive/GoogleDrive/Dropbox software on your device.
