I need the ID to check against some JSON output. This element doesn't have a tag.

Download the XSD schema for the form by selecting Actions &gt; Versions &gt; Action &gt; Download Schema, then open the file in a code editor.

Alternatively, click **Get Help** for the element in the form designer, than grab the value for ElementId from your address bar for the Help Request form.
