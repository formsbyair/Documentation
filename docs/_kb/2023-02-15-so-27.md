My conditions have images and special formatting so the usual approach of &lt;&lt;\[Condition:XXX == true:My text and images\]&gt;&gt; doesn't work properly

Use tables \(you can set the borders to be invisible\)

If the condition evaluates to **true** the table row will be retained and we’ll just remove the condition statement

If the condition evaluates to **false** then the whole row will be removed
