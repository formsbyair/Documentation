If you have a multi-select option question and you want all of the options to appear in the auto generated pdf if an option like 'none of the above' is selected.

One option is to change these questions from "Option" to "True/False", they will then display in the pdf as shown below.

Another option \(if you don't want to alter the structure of the fields/form\) is to add a 'Display Content' field if 'None of the above' is selected with details of the options not chosen.
