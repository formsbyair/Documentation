I want to put a minimum date in place, so user can only select T+5 days for example. I have tried putting "=DateTime.Today.AddWeekDays\(5\)" in the minimum value cell but doesnt work

Instead of setting Min Value on your date field, use a separate hidden formula field with an Expression like this...

'&lt;&lt;StartDate&gt;&gt;' == '' || moment\('&lt;&lt;StartDate&gt;&gt;'\).isAfter\(moment\(\).add\(5, 'days'\)\)
</div>
