This is due to a rounding issue with floating point numbers in Javascript.

FBA stores percentages as a decimal, so 50% = 0.5

In Javascript, adding 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.999999999 instead of 1

As such you need to round as follows...

Math.round\(&lt;&lt;TotalPercent&gt;&gt; \* 100\) / 100

This assumes you're dealing with percentages to 0dp e.g. 50%

If you're dealing with higher precision e.g. 1dp or 50.5% then you need to implement as follows...

Math.round\(&lt;&lt;TotalPercent&gt;&gt; \* 1000\) / 1000
</div>
