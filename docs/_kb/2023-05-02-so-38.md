If I access my form direct then GA events are logged OK, but if I access the form through my website \(which has the form embedded\) then no events are recorded.

You need to set cookie\_flags as follows to log events from embedded forms \(in iframe\)

gtag\('config', 'G-XXXXXXX', \{ cookie\_flags: 'max-age=7200;secure;samesite=none' \}\);
</div>
