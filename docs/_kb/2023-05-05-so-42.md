### Answer by Anonymous ✅ (Accepted)
1. Create a Word template for your file i.e. just a new Word document
2. Edit the **footer** of your template to include tags for the dates you want e.g. &lt;&lt;\[DocumentReceivedDateTime\]&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;\[DocumentWorkflowDateTime:Approved\]&gt;&gt;
3. Close and save the document
4. Change your FBA integration to "PDF From Template" and upload the template you created
