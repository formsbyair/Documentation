I need to send an email using an email address captured in my form, or if that is blank, to another default email address.

You can use the &lt;&lt;\[Expression\]&gt;&gt; tag for the recipient of your email as follows:

&lt;&lt;\[Expression:'&lt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&gt;' != '' ? '&lt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&gt;' : 'default-email-address@formsbyair.com'\]&gt;&gt;

This assume the content of the email is the same. If you want to send a *different* email if no email address has been provided you should use multiple email integrations with conditional expressions.
