There's a few options...

Instead of using a Hidden field you could use a regular display field **inside** a Workflow element. This won't display in the regular form view, but will be included in PDF output.

You could include it in the Filename of the PDF \(especially if it's just a reference\)

You could setup a Word template for the PDF file, and use tags to display the hidden field in the header or footer.
