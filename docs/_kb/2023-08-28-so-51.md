My form has many, small sections - how can I make them flow one after the other in PDF/Word output instead of starting a new page for each section?

Create a new Word document to use as a template. Go to Page Setup, and then Layout. Change "Section start" to **Continuous** instead of **New Page.** Upload this template to your integration.
