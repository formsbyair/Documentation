Form attachments can’t be sent on their own, they get included when you generate a file for a form e.g. a PDF

The easiest option is to create an integration with “Send form data in a file” and Delivery Method “Email Attachment”.

Alternatively, you can create an Email integration and set “Attach Email Files” to Internal. Then create a File integration and make sure the “Internal Email” checkbox is checked.

We strongly recommend that you don’t attach photos of identity documents to emails – safer to deliver them direct to an application or file storage.
