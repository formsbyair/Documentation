Is there a maximum number of days we can use for the Document Request Expiry option? Can we set it to 90 days? And does the Document request expiry apply to both the save and finish later option and the first Send Request email?

You can set request expiry to whatever you need, 90 days is fine.

**Request Expiry** applies where a form has been prefilled, and the client hasn't added any data themselves yet.

**Save Expiry** applies as soon as a form is saved the first time. It's a rolling 30 day expiry, and extends out every time you re-save. It's a smaller window on purpose because the form is higher risk once the client starts entering their data.
