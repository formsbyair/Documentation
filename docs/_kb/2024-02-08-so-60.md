For one of our forms, employees seem to be receiving 'New Submission' - Workflow emails without having their email address on any kind of notification, or submission email list. Just wondering how this is happening and if it is something that I have set up.

Yes, our system will send workflow notifications to users by default.

If you've setup custom notifications, or don't need notifications at all, you can disable this behaviour in form settings...
