an issue we've come across is with our updating details form.

The existing integration for updating, is changing the types of all the variables into strings. E.g the GrantPrice should be a Number \(34\), but upon submitting update these change into a string \("34"\). In our json map we've put "type": "Int" but that seems to do nothing.

We need some variables to stay as strings and others to be numbers. Just wondering where we state what type a variable need to save in.

No problem... please add Setter: float to your mapping file for all number types...

```
        {
          "Name": "GrantPrice",
          "Value": "<<GrantPrice>>",
          "Setter": "float"
        }
```
</div>
