How can I count the number of responses in a multi-select?

for example if I need a conditional path if 2 or more responses have been selected?

Use this expression to get the number of selected options where **Option** is the Tag Name for all of your option elements.

```
<<[Count:Option{'<<Option>>' == 'true'}]>>
```
</div>
