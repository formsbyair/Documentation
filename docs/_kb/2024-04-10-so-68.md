title: "Can I use conditional statements in the Confirmation Editor?"

I'm trying to output custom text in the confirmation message on submit of the form.

This is the syntax I'm using in the editor:

&lt;&lt;\[Condition:'&lt;&lt;\[DocumentStage\]&gt;&gt;' == '1\_Admin':An email has been sent to the broker.\]&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;\[Condition:'&lt;&lt;\[DocumentStage\]&gt;&gt;' == '2\_Broker':Your acknowledgement form has been sent to your regional manager for sign off.\]&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;\[Condition:'&lt;&lt;\[DocumentStage\]&gt;&gt;' == '3\_RegionalManager':The acknowledgement form has been sent to the general manager for final sign off.\]&gt;&gt;

Below is a screenshot of output on submit of the first stage \(1\_Admin\) - all conditional options are being output with some of the conditional syntax:

Is the syntax incorrect, or is not possible to have conditional statements in the Confirmation type editor?

Not sure if this is relevant - the conditional syntax was added directly into the editor. When previewing the code, the angle brackets "&lt;", "&gt;" had been converted to html entities:

The Confirmation Editor only supports tag replacement, it doesn't evaluate expressions.

You'd need to use a hidden formula field for your expression\(s\), then refer to that with a tag in the Confirmation Editor.
