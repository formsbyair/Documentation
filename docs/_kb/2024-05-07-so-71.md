Just to check - are you saying that you have "Display Content" in your form \(with bullet points or numbered lists\) that you want to apply formatting to in the PDF output \(using a Word template\) ?

As it stands, you can use Word styles for some elements \(as per [https://docs.formsbyair.com/templates/word/](https://docs.formsbyair.com/templates/word/)\) but not list items.

Another option would be to use a Word template with &lt;&lt;tags&gt;&gt; so we're populating specific data rather than dumping out everything in the form. You can then "hard code" display content in to the template using whatever formatting you need.
