I have a form with a lot of conditions and questions that generates a 20 pages PDf.
This PDF uses a WORD template but it is not a custom word due to the amount of questions and conditions.
We need to display some information on the last page of this PDF.
Is there a way to insert a Custom footer on the last page of automated PDF ?

Yes that's fine, just create a new **section** in your Word document, and add content \(or a footer\) to that section.

FBA will inject form data in the first section of your document as long as it's left blank.
