### Answer by Carolyn Wilson ✅ (Accepted)
Add a "new Set Expression", such as:

\[...new Set\('a|b|c|a|b|c'.split\('|'\)\)\].join\(", "\)

If the string were 'a|b|c|a|b|c', splitting it with | would give you 'a, b, c'

Note: Each value in the original list is separated buy a '|' character.

Example:  \[...new Set\('&lt;&lt;\[ForEach:Fund\[|\]:&lt;&lt;FundName&gt;&gt;\]&gt;&gt;'.split\('|'\)\)\].join\(", "\)

The expression starts with a string, splits it into parts based on |, removes duplicates, and then joins those parts back together into a single string, separated by commas.
