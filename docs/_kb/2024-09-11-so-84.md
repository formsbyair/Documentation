title: "FormsbyAir Comment box text formatting to flow through to Cliniko"

I have a comment box in a form that I have created, I would like to have the formatting of the text in the box preserved when it goes through the json file to then create the entry in Cliniko with line breaks carried across, is this possible?

I have tried to wrap the tag in &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; in the json file but this has not changed the output in Cliniko.

Thank you

Please edit your Cliniko mapping file and change the value for **type** from "text" to "paragraph" for each applicable treatment note field

```
        {
          "Name": "treatment_notes",
          "Attributes": [
            {
              "Name": "name",
              "Value": "Presenting complaint"
            },
            {
              "Name": "type",
              "Value": "paragraph"
            },
            {
              "Name": "answer",
              "Value": "<<ReasonForVisit>>"
            }
          ]
        }
```
