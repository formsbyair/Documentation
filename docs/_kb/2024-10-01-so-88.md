title: "Forms not functioning on older model iPads"

We are having issues with our older model iPads not loading FBA forms for the past 2 weeks, we have tried with iOS12, 15 and 16.3.

We are getting to the forms \(it is affecting more then just one form\) via a web link, which works without issue when using iPhone iOS 17 & 18 or from a desktop

We have tried using, Safari, DuckDuckGo and Firefox and none have loaded the page, it is just a white page with no content

Can you please advise

Thank you

It looks like there may be a problem with iOS 16.3 and earlier, iOS 16.4 and above seems OK.

We're investigating, but in the meantime, are you able to update iOS on the affected devices to 16.4 or newer?

We've now resolved the issue with iPad/iOS compatibility, we've tested back to iOS 12.4
