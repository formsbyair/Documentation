I am creating a custom word doc template for my form output. Is it possible to output the repeater title and number from the form in the output file? I can hard code the title into my word doc, and I have tried count and sum but this gives me the total of repeaters that have been used in the form. Or, it outputs "1" for each repeater.

Use the **&lt;&lt;\[Index\]&gt;&gt;** tag in your template, for example

```
Locality #<<[Index]>>
```

> * Hey @ShaunDavis. Do I need to use an escape character before my greater than symbol '>' if I only want to output the index number when the repeater is greater than 1. I've tried using the following syntax and I broke my word doc template:  <<[Condition:'<<[Index]>>' > '1':#<<[Index]>>]>>Thanks in advance for your help.
