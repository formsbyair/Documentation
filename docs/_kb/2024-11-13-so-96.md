I've setup an email integration to send "On Save" with recipient &lt;&lt;MainContactEmailAddress&gt;&gt;

If I start my form, click "Save & Finish Later" enter my email address, and click Save, I don't get the email, and the integration has an error "No Recipients"

The element\(s\) with tag name "MainContactEmailAddress" are probably behind an inactive conditional path, so the email address you enter is not getting saved in the form. Try using an email address field that is always visible, or add a hidden formula field to store the email address.
