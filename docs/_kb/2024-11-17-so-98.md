We have a requirement for a item to be mandatory if it is made in a third party request, but if that same item is currently displayed in the main form, then it is not mandatory.

This is to allow capture of information from the main form filler, but only require active confirmation of that \(basically a I declare this is true and correct tickbox\) if it is actually farmed out as a Third Party Request.
