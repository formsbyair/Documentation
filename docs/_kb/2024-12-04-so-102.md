Cliniko has allowed you to create custom fields in the Patient Details section, I can't seem to map to it. Can you please advise?

Ive attempted to just use the name field - this resulted in nothing appearing

Ive attempted to treat the field as an entity \(like the phone number entry\) - but this didn't work either and caused the integration to fail

Thank you

Please map custom fields as per example below...

```
{
  "Entities": [
    {
      "Name": "patient",
      "Attributes": [
      ],
      "Entities": [
        {
          "Name": "custom_fields",
          "Attributes": [
            {
              "Name": "section",
              "Value": "General Practitioner Details"
            },
            {
              "Name": "name",
              "Value": "Practitioner Name"
            },
            {
              "Name": "value",
              "Value": "<<PractitionerName>>"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "custom_fields",
          "Attributes": [
            {
              "Name": "section",
              "Value": "General Practitioner Details"
            },
            {
              "Name": "name",
              "Value": "Practice Name"
            },
            {
              "Name": "value",
              "Value": "<<PracticeName>>"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
