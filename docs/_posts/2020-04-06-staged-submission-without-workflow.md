title: Staged Submission without workflow
type: feature
---

Staged Submission is now supported for forms that don't use workflow. This may be helpful for forms that require progressive review and completion by multiple external users.

When a stage is submitted, the document will advance to the next stage and revert to SAVED status. Emails can be triggered at each stage to notify the relevant party to access the document and complete their stage.
