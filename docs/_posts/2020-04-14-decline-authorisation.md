title: Decline Authorisation
type: feature
---

Changed the behaviour of **Decline** during Authorisation to revert the document to pending status and assign it to the person that requested authorisation - rather than *Deleting* the document.

Also added the ability to specify a comment when you Decline a document at any stage.
