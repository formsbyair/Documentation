title: Mandatory third party requests for staged forms
type: platform
---

We've made the following changes for **Mandatory** Third Party Requests located in the last stage of forms configured for staged submission.

* FormsByAir will automatically generate the requests on submit of the second-to-last stage. This ensures the requests are sent directly to the third parties. The main form filler has no ability to access or cancel the requests, they can only view the status of them.
* Submission of the *last* request will automatically trigger submission of the main form

Combined, these features are useful where a form request for an existing group of people is sent to a primary contact for general completion, but must be viewed/authorised by *all* parties.
