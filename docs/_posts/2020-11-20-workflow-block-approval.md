title: Workflow Block Approval
type: platform
---

Added **Block Approval** option for workflow elements.

The intent is for this to be used in conjunction with conditional paths to block the approval of submissions in certain situations. e.g. where a form user has indicated that they want to query something before proceeding.

When this happens, the **Approve** action will be unavailable, with **Return** taking it's place as the default action.

A form administrator can address the query and/or edit the form, then Return it to the user to re-submit such that the approval-blocking workflow element is no longer active.
