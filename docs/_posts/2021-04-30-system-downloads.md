title: System downloads
type: fix

We've updated the manual **Download** document function in the portal to support *multiple* **System Download** File integrations. 

You've always been able to set the **System Download** flag on multiple File integrations, but FormsByAir would only return the first one. Now it will return all System Download files in a ZIP.

As before, if the document has client or server side attachments, these will be included in the ZIP. If there are no System Download File integrations configured then FormsByAir will return an auto-generated PDF with no attachments.

The intent behind the Download function remains the same in that it is a convenience feature for adhoc use. Any files you rely on must be delivered via other, automated channels.
