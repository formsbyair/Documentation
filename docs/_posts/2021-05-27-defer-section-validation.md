title: Defer section validation
type: platform
---

We've added a new setting to defer the validation of individual sections until a form is submitted. By default, sections are validated as you move to the next section.

This may be useful for very large forms where users can move ahead and complete as much as they can without being blocked by a few mandatory questions that they can answer later.

This is not recommended for any sections that drive significant conditional content later in the form.
