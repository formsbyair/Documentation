We've updated the prompt within the "blue box" for non-mandatory third party requests to clarify that users have a choice for us to send the request link, or they can send it themselves.

### Previous Message
Add an email address &amp; message below if you want us to send the request automatically, then click Generate Request.

### New Message
Add an Email Address below if you want us to send the request link for you, otherwise leave blank if you'd prefer to send it yourself, then click Generate Request.
