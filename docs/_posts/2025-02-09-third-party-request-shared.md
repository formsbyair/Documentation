title: Third party request shared
type: platform
---

By default, the information submitted in third-party requests is hidden from other people completing requests in the same form.

This is good for the typical uses-case where you're capturing personal details for multiple people that don't need to be shared with the group.

However, in some cases, you may need to share this information, so we've added a new option **Shared** to Request elements.
