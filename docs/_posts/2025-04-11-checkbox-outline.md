FormsByAir uses the popular Bootstrap library to style our forms.

In recent versions, the Bootstrap team have moved towards a low-contrast aesthetic, which among other things, has seen them lighten the border colour of checkbox and radio buttons.

We've had feedback from multiple customers that the border colour is now too light, and difficult for form fillers to distinguish.

As such we've restored the previous (darker) grey by default. This can still be overridden with custom CSS.

It's worth noting that the click area for checkboxes and radio buttons has always included the corresponding *label* in addition to the actual box/circle control.
