FormsByAir has been scanning file attachments for viruses using ClamAV for some time.

We've now extended our scanning to detect the **type** of a file irrespective of its extension or mime type. If the detected type doesn't match with an allowed type, we flag the file as potential malware.

In addition, if the detected file type is .html or .svg we scan the contents for javascript, and if present the file is also flagged as potential malware.

This change applies to both attachments in forms and uploads to our portal.
