title: Validation Lock

We've added a new Format option **Lock** to Validation elements.

This option is slighly counter-intuitive, as it won't actually trigger any validation. Instead it allows a Validation element to act as a container of other elements that can be locked for edit when a button in a form is clicked.

This may be useful where you have an element or elements that heavily influence content in the rest of the form, and you don't want users to switch values once selected.

We offer similar fuctionality with the **Forward-Only** option for sections, but that applies to a whole section, and doesn't allow you to go back and view those details once you have moved to the next section.
