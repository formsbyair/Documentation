We've added a new **Sentence Case** format option for Text questions.

This will auto-capitalise the first letter only, and leave the rest unchanged.

This is different to **Title Case** which auto-capitalises the first letter of each *word*, and forces other letters to lower case.

Sentence Case may be useful for capturing Names where you always want the first letter capitalised, but don't want to interfere with subsequent capitalisation around names like O'Shay or MacDonald.
