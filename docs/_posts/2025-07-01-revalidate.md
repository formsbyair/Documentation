We've updated the "Send New Request" button within validation elements in Workflow.

This button appears when a validation is in Requesting, Check or Fail status.

The original intent was for it be used with biometric identity verifications where a form user had lost their request link or needed to re-verify.

We've since found that this feature is useful for other validation types that don't involve sending a request e.g. where form data has been edited post submit

As such the button now appears for all validation types as **Revalidate** except biometric identity verification where it will remain as **Send New Request**
