We've updated the label for the "Send New Request" button within validation elements in Workflow.

This button appears when a validation is in Requesting, Check or Fail status.

The original intent was for it be used with biometric identity verifications where a form user had lost their request link or needed to re-verify.

However, the button was also appearing for other validations in Check or Fail status, and for those the label "Send New Request" was misleading, and causing confusion.

As such the button now appears as **Revalidate** for all validation types except biometric identity verification where a request has to be sent.
