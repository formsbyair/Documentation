title: Collapsible sections in Workflow
type: platform
---

Form sections in Workflow are now collapsible, which may be useful where you need to focus on a specific section for review.

All form sections will open expanded by default, but can be closed/opened by clicking the title or the up/down arrow in the header.

Hidden sections will automatically expand to reveal validation errors on Authorisation or Approval.
