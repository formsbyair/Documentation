title: Validation Hide
type: platform
---

Similar to the "Lock" option we added recently, we've added a new Format option **Hide** to Validation elements.

This option won't trigger any validation, instead it allows a Validation element to act as a container of other elements that can be hidden when a button in the form is clicked.

This may be useful where you have an element or elements that capture sensitive information that should be hidden from other form users while the form is being filled out. These elements will still appear in Workflow and all output as normal.
