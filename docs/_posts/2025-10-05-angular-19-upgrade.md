title: Angular 19 Upgrade
type: platform
---

We are planning to upgrade our forms and portal from Angular 18 to 19 in the coming weeks to stay within Google's support window.

This is a moderate upgrade which will require some code changes to our platform, but there are no anticipated breaking changes for any forms.

We will provide a separate test environment for partners to test their forms against the new version before we switch our production environment, and will advise on a timeline for the upgrade once testing is complete.
