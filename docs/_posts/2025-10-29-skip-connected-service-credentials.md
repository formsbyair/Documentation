title: Skip connected service credentials
type: platform
---

We've added a new option to **Skip** entering credentials for a connected service when adding or editing an integration.

This may be useful for initial setup of a new form or when copying a form between accounts where the credentials aren't available yet.

The connected service will still be listed under Administration > Connected Services, but won't show a CONNECTED status until credentials have been entered.
