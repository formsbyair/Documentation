title: Cancel Requesting validation
type: platform
---

We've added a new **Cancel** option for validation elements in **Requesting** status, typically in relation to ID verification.

This may be useful where verification has since been completed outside of the form, and the form doesn't need to go back to the client with **Reset &amp; Return**

Once cancelled, the form will move to Workflow where it can be edited, for example, to select manual ID verification and attach the relevant documents.
