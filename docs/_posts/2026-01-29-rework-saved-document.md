title: Rework Saved document
type: platform

We've modified permissions around the **Rework** option in our portal for Delivered and Saved documents.

Reworking a **Delivered** document is rare, and is still only available to users in the Administrator or Controller roles.

Reworking a **Saved** document is more common, for example, where a form was Returned in error, or the form filler no longer needs to update it, and you want to move the form back in to Workflow without triggering any integrations. This option is now available to users in the **Supervisor** role in addition to Administrators and Controllers.
