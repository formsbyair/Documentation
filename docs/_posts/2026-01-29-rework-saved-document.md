title: Rework Saved document
type: platform
---

We've modified permissions around the **Rework** option in our portal, which is available for both Delivered and Saved documents.

Reworking a **Delivered** document is rare, and is still only available to users in the Administrator or Controller roles.

Reworking a **Saved** document is more common, for example, where a form was Returned in error, or the user no longer needs to update it, and you want to move the form back in to Workflow without triggering any integrations. This option is now avilable to users in the **Supervisor** role in addition to Administrators and Controllers.
