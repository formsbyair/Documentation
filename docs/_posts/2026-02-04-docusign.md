We've added a new integration with Docusign to support forms that require a more formal signing process.

When enabled, FormsByAir will generate a PDF of a submitted form and automatically create a Docusign envelope, including recipients and signature tags. Docusign then manage the signing workflow and return the fully signed PDF to us once all parties have completed signing, triggering delivery of the form.

This integration complements our existing "in form" electronic signature capture feature, which is sufficient for most forms.

Docusign may be appropriate where a form is a deed or contract and legal or other requirements call for a traditional signing workflow.

This integration requires FormsByAir clients to have their own Docusign account, transactions are billed directly by Docusign.
